Image Segmentation using Segment Anything Model (SAM)
This repository implements image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), developed by Meta AI. SAM is a powerful, flexible model that can segment any object in an image based on user input (e.g., points, bounding boxes, or masks). The model generalizes well across different domains and is pre-trained on large-scale datasets, making it effective for a wide range of segmentation tasks.

Introduction
Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify its representation and make analysis easier. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) by Meta AI allows for highly flexible segmentation based on user prompts, making it adaptable to a wide variety of images and domains without requiring fine-tuning.

Key Features:
Zero-shot segmentation for any object in an image
Multiple prompt-based segmentation options (e.g., bounding boxes, points, masks)
Scalable and adaptable across domains (natural images, medical images, etc.)
